            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>The journey of Centurion University of Technology and Management (CUTM) began in the year 2005 by a group of ambitious academics with aspirations to provide high quality education both nationally and internationally. The first step in this direction was to take over an ailing engineering Institute, the Jagannath Institute for Technology and Management (JITM) in one of the most challenging tribal districts of Odisha and one which was considered to be a left-wing extremist affected area. Subsequently, JITM was transformed into Centurion University of Technology and Management in August 2010, through an act of Odisha Legislative Assembly. It became the First Multi-Sector State Private University in Odisha.The core objective of CUTM is ‘shaping lives and empower communities’, and creating wealth and livelihood opportunities at the bottom of the pyramid. The objective is achieved through education and training, financial services and other projects in rural communities, particularly in southern Odisha and northern coastal Andhra Pradesh. CUTM has strong environmental as well as social values. The University leads a network of educational institutions delivering primary, secondary, tertiary and vocational education and training. CUTM evolved from the Jagannath Institute of Technology and Management (JITM) and Centurion School of Rural Enterprise Management (CSREM) at Parlakhemundi, and the Centurion Institute of Technology (CIT) at Jatni, Bhubaneswar.The Centurion School of Vocational Education is integral to the university. It imparts ITI and Diploma education through Centurion Industrial Training Centers (CITCs), at nine locations in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Centurion group also runs a number of Higher Secondary Science Colleges and Public Schools in Odisha.</p>
            <br>

<p>To bridge the gap between theory and practice, the University works in close association with its Gram Tarang Group of sister organizations involved in social entrepreneurship outreach activities</p>
            <br>

<p>The Gram Tarang Employability Training Service Pvt. Ltd. (GTETS) is an employment oriented skill building initiative focusing on socially weaker sections of society, especially school dropouts in rural Odisha. Over 21,000 students have been trained through various programs in collaboration with the industry (NALCO, Vedanta, Simplex, Navayuga, and IL&FS). GTETS is a special purpose vehicle created by CUTM and the second ever partner of National Skill Development Corporation to help upscale its existing vocational training activities. It implements various skill building programs ongoing at CUTM. It has received recognition from FICCI and United Nations for its innovative employment linked skill development program.</p>
            <br>

<p>The Gram Tarang Inclusive Development Services (GTIDS) attempts to provide financial service to the bottom of the pyramid clients through about 4000 banking correspondents in partnership with technology partners like Punjab National Bank, Andhra Bank, Indus Ind Bank United Bank of India & Union Bank of India. Presently GTIDS operates in nine states and has the mandate to take this to 10,000 Gram Panchayats (GPs) by 2012.</p>
            <br>

<p>The Gram Tarang Self Help Cooperative (GTSHC) looks at rural Indian as a partner rather
than a market and constructively engages with the local community, especially through women Self Help Groups (SHG) across rural Odisha, to source, produce and market various products ranging from soap and sanitary napkins to financial product like life insurance.</p>
            <br>

<p>The Gram Tarang Foods Pvt. Ltd. (GTFPL) undertakes value addition of agricultural produces near the source of production, though process like spice oil extraction, and consequently offering alternative employment opportunities to local population</p>
            <br>

<p>The Centurion Group of Institutions have more than 200 acres of campus area and 8,00,000 sq ft of built-up area across nine locations in Odisha (Jatni, Paralakhemundi, Koraput, Rayagada, Bolangir and Balasore) and Andhra Pradesh (Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabed, Kanchili and Pathpatanam).
